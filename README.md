# Tidy-Olympic

## Context
This project was to train and test different R graphics and learn how to use R-markdown for the first time for my R studio Class at my time at Lake Forest College. This dataset looks into the people who have participated in the Olympics and I wanted to know the distribution of countries who have earned medals in Archery.

## Quick Insights
-South Korea has earned the most medals in Archery, then Belgium and finally France
-South Korea hold 36.6% of Gold medals in Archery
-South Korean Females Have earned most of the Archery Medals compared to South Korean Males
